            topology (Literal['cycle', 'linear1', 'linear', 'nonlinear'], optional): The desired topology 
                of the layout. It can be 'cycle', 'linear1' (connected, in the same row), 'linear' (connected, 
                not necessarily in the same row), or 'nonlinear'. Defaults to 'linear1'.
            printdetails (bool, optional): If True, prints details about the selected layout. Defaults to False.
    
        Returns:
            list: A list of qubits representing the selected layout.
